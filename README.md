# Exam-Setter 
>This is an application that has a core function of setting exams from a collection of questions input by the administrators. 
>
>It is a web application that stores questions provided by users representing different high schools to enhance sharing of knowledge. The system should be able to relate each question to its frequency of setting so that when setting an exam, there shouldn't be repetition. 

>The system should be able to provide a full set paper for all the subjects in high school, whenever queried, giving priority to the newer questions in the database. The system should also be able to relate a certain question to its topic in the sylabus as well as form(e.g form 1, 2) 
>
>A full exam consists of several questions. The questions some time get accompanied by diagrams or pictures. 
>
>Everytime the system prints an exam, it should be different from the previous ones. Some questions are designated for some specific numbers in the exam, e.g number one in maths is always a log or integer question.
>
>The system should take care of the diversity in paper setting, e.g in Chemistry we have paper1 and paper2 and paper3.
Schools are identified by their pk and and names only.
>
>The system should be able to rate the contributors so as to identify  the members who aren't doing anything. 
>Only the  one who submitted a question shoould be allowed to edit it.
